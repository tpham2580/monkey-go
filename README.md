# üêí Monkey Programming Language

An interpreter for the **Monkey Programming Language**, implemented in Go. This project follows the book *[Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com)* by Thorsten Ball.

## ‚ú® Features
- **REPL**: Interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop for live coding.
- **Basic Syntax**: Supports variable bindings, arithmetic expressions, conditionals, and more.
- **Data Structures**: Includes support for arrays and hashes.
- **Functions**: First-class and closures.
- **Garbage-Free**: Managed entirely in Go!


## üìù TODO
- [ ] **Lexer**: Tokenize input strings into meaningful tokens.
- [ ] **Parser**: Build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens.
- [ ] **Evaluator**: Execute the AST to produce results.
- [ ] **Environment**: Implement variable bindings and scoping.
- [ ] **REPL**: Create a Read-Eval-Print Loop for user interaction.
- [ ] **Control Structures**: Add support for `if`, `else`, and conditionals.
- [ ] **Functions**: Implement first-class functions with closures.
- [ ] **Data Structures**:
  - [ ] Arrays
  - [ ] Hashes
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add meaningful error messages for syntax and runtime errors.
- [ ] **Garbage Collection**: Manage memory and clean up unused objects.
